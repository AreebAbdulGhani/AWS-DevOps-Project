CI/CD for AWS DevOps with AWS CodeCommit and CodeBuild

I have created Continuous integration for now, next I'm going to create Continuous deployment, Hence CI/CD with CodePipeline with AWS.

The code was at CodeCommit and from there the code passes on to CodeBuild where as it name suggest, the code has been build and then the Artifact of the CodeBuild was stored at AWS S3 and once the code is stored, then you can deploy it anytime, hence comes into picture CodeDeploy.

Try out this project, it'll give you a complete hands-on experience of CI/CD in AWS DevOps workflow.
